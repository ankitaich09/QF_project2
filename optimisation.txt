practical test for convexity

iff H(x) is positive semi definite on the convex set of X

necessary condition for local mini

f(x*+hp) >= f(x*)

optimisation with linesearch

take an initial guess X0, k=0
find a search (descent) direction p(k)
decide on a step size h(k)
X(k+1) = X(k) + h(k)*p(k)

till X(k) is good enough

meaning X(K+1) - X(K) <= pre-defined tolerance 

or 

I reach max number of iterations


practice: implement backtracking 

choose alpha (a) > 0, 

until

f(x+ap)<= f(x) + c.a.p*grad(f(x))

Input: function, currentpos (x), p (search direction), gradient_function

Output: alpha (Step size)

c = 0.1, p=0.5, a = 1;
